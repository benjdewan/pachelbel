# Schema v1
v1 of the pachelbel configuration describes a single object, the deployment object.

```yaml
# The config is versioned. Objects of different config_versions can be used in
# a single pachelbel provision run.
config_version: 1

# Compose offers many database types.
type: mongodb|rethinkdb|postgresql|redis|rabbitmq|etcd|elastic_search|mysql|janusgraph|disque

# By default the latest stable version of the specified databse type is used.
# Use the 'version' field to specify an older version, or if you want to update
# an existing deployment to a newer version
version: 3.2.10

# pachelbel supports deployments to datacenters *or* clusters *or* tags. You
# cannot specify more than one of these fields for any single deployment.
#
# pachelbel will attempt to map the cluster-name to an ID. If that cluster
# does not exist or is not visible when using the provided API token, pachelbel
# will throw an error. There is currently no support for the creation/deleting
# of clusters.
cluster: my-softlayer-cluster

# pachelbel supports deployments to datacenters *or* clusters *or* tags. You
# cannot specify more than one of these fields for any single deployment.
#
# the value provided here should be a datacenter slug as returned by the compose
# API
datacenter: aws:us-east-1

# pachelbel supports deployments to datacenters *or* clusters *or* tags. You
# cannot specify more than one of these fields for any single deployment.
#
# pachelbel does not currently validate that the provided tags exist, but
# provisioning a deployment will fail if they do not.
tags:
  - dev
  - benjdewan

# The name of the deployment must be <64 characters, but is otherwise very
# flexible.
name: postgres-benjdewan-01

# notes can include additional metadata about this deployment
notes: |
    This is a test of pachelbel

# Optionally specify the scaling size of the deployment. The default is '1'
scaling: 2

# For databases that support ssl, use this line to ensure it is set.
ssl: true

# The timeout period, in seconds, to wait for provisioning recipes (creating
# new deployments, scaling existing deployments &c.) to complete. If no recipes
# are triggered, no waiting will occur.
#
# If this field is not set a default timeout of 300 seconds (5 minutes) is used.
timeout: 900

# If you want to make this deployment visible to anyone other than the user that
# created it, you should create a team via the web interface, grab the team ID, and
# then specify it here along with the roles that team should have:
teams:
  - id: "123456789"
    role: "admin"
  - id: "123456789"
    role: "developer"

# WiredTiger is a storage engine option for MongoDB. Setting this field for
# any other type of deployment will throw an error
wired_tiger: true

# Multiple YAML configuration objects can be combined into a single file separated
# using the standard yaml separator: `\n---\n`.
