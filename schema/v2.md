# Schema v2

Schema v2 currently supports the following object types:
* [endpoint_map](#endpoint_map)
* [deployment_client](#deployment_client)

## endpoint_map

An endpoint map defines conversions to be run against deployment endpoint URLs returned by Compose.io. An enterprise Compose cluster may be configured to only return an endpoint that requires VPN access even though the deployment itself has a public-facing endpoint, and you can use an endpoint map to translate from one to the other.

### Format
```yaml
config_version: 2
object_type: endpoint_map
endpoint_map:
  {{.KEY_ONE}}: {{.VALUE_ONE}}
  {{.KEY_TWO}}: {{.VALUE_TWO}}
  ...
```

Restrictions:
* A single key cannot map to multiple values.
* The map will resolve recursively up to 8 times before triggering a panic. I don't have cycle detection working yet and this prevents an infinite loop.

### Example
Given this configuration
```yaml
config_version: 2
object_type: endpoint_map
endpoint_map:
  cluster-benjdewan-01.compose.direct: haproxy-v1.public.legacy.com
  haproxy-v1.public.legacy.com: endpoint.example.net
```

and this returned connection string for a deployment called `postgres-benjdewan-01`:

```
postgres://admin:PASSWORD@cluster-benjdewan-01.compose.direct:45678/compose
```

The output of `pachelbel` will be:
```yaml
name: postgres-benjdewan-01
type: postgresql
connections:
  - scheme: postgres
    host: endpoint.example.net
    username: admin
    password: PASSWORD
    port: 45678
    path: /compose
```

## deployment_client

A deployment_client object is used to return connection information for a deployment that is managed by another team.

When developing multiple services it is highly likely that some of them will share Compose deployments. For example having an orchestrator service passing jobs to workers using a single Redis queue. In a scenario like this the orchestrator service should own and manage the deployment, and the worker services should not have the ability to modify the deployment configuration during rollout, but the workers still need the connection info to utilize it.

It may help to think of a `deployment_client` as a read-only information request to the Compose API about a deployment that should exist, and if it doesn't an error is thrown because the deployment owner, not the client has to handle creation

NOTE: You cannot specify a deployment object and a deployment_client object with the same name in a single `pachelbel provision` run. Either pachelbel has the ability to create/update a deployment or it doesn't.

### Format
```yaml
config_version: 2
object_type: deployment_client
name: {{.NAME_OF_EXISTING_DEPLOYMENT}}
type: {{.TYPE_OF_EXISTING_DEPLOYMENT}}
```

### Example
```yaml
config_version: 2
object_type: deployment_client
name: postgres-benjdewan-01
type: postgresql
```
